## Introduction

The Wiggly Band Physics Simulation is an interactive exploration of fundamental physics concepts that bridges the gap between theoretical particle physics and observable wave phenomena. This simulator models oscillating entities called "wiggly bands" that exhibit properties inspired by both string theory and classical wave mechanics.

### Purpose
- **Educational**: Visualize complex physics concepts in an intuitive way
- **Experimental**: Explore emergent behaviors from simple interaction rules
- **Musical**: Investigate harmonic relationships and sound synthesis
- **Theoretical**: Model particle-like interactions at a conceptual level

## Scientific Background

### String Theory Connection

In string theory, the fundamental building blocks of nature are not point particles but tiny vibrating strings of energy. Different vibrational modes of these strings give rise to different particles - an electron might be a string vibrating one way, while a quark vibrates differently.

String theory posits that particles like electrons and quarks are actually strings undergoing particular vibrational patterns, with mass and charge determined by how a string vibrates.

Our wiggly bands model this concept by:
- Representing fundamental entities as oscillating objects rather than points
- Using frequency as a primary property (analogous to particle type)
- Showing how different "vibrational modes" create different behaviors

### Quarks and Electromagnetic Interactions

Quarks are the only elementary particles that engage in all four fundamental interactions: electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, and weak interaction. They have fractional electric charges (+2/3 or -1/3 of an electron's charge).

The strong force is approximately 100 times as strong as electromagnetism at the scale of atomic nuclei, binding quarks together into protons and neutrons.

The simulator models charge interactions through:
- Positive and negative charges on each band
- Configurable interaction rules (attraction/repulsion/neutral)
- Field-based forces that decrease with distance
- Multiple charge points creating complex field patterns

### Wave Physics and Harmonics

A vibration in a string is a wave. Resonance causes a vibrating string to produce a sound with constant frequency. The speed of propagation depends on tension and linear density.

The frequencies of harmonics are whole-number multiples of the fundamental frequency. If the fundamental is 1 Hz, the second harmonic is 2 Hz, the third is 3 Hz, and so on.

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Wiggly Bands as Fundamental Entities**
Each band represents a quantum-like entity with properties:
- **Frequency** (100-2000 Hz): Analogous to particle type/energy
- **Amplitude** (5-50): Oscillation strength
- **Charge** (±0.1 to ±5): Electromagnetic interaction strength
- **Phase Offset**: Initial oscillation state
- **Elasticity** (1-50%): Shape deformation response

### 2. **Field Interactions**
Bands generate oscillating electromagnetic-like fields:
- Field points at oscillation extrema (peaks and troughs)
- Alternating charge regions create complex field patterns
- Interaction strength follows inverse distance relationship
- Configurable rules for charge interactions

### 3. **Harmonization and Resonance**
Resonance occurs when a system is driven at its natural frequency, producing standing waves with maximum amplitude.

The simulator detects harmonic relationships:
- **Octave** (2:1 ratio): Most stable harmonic
- **Perfect Fifth** (3:2): Strong consonance
- **Perfect Fourth** (4:3): Stable interval
- **Major/Minor Thirds** (5:4, 6:5): Pleasant harmonies

### 4. **Emergent Behaviors**
When bands interact, several behaviors can emerge:
- **Merging**: Bands combine properties (mass/energy conservation)
- **Harmony Rings**: Nested oscillations (up to 8 bands)
- **Tethering**: Elastic connections between harmonizing bands
- **Oscillating Bands**: Properties cycle between two states
- **Resonance**: Bands emit sympathetic vibrations

## Physics Implementation

### Force Calculations

The simulator uses a modified electromagnetic force model:

```javascript
// Simplified force calculation
Force = (fieldStrength * chargeProduct * distanceFactor) / distance²

where:
- fieldStrength: Global multiplier (0-0.1)
- chargeProduct: Interaction based on charge signs
- distanceFactor: Smooth falloff function
- distance: Euclidean distance between entities
```

### Interaction Rules

Configurable charge interactions:
- **Negative → Positive**: Attraction (default)
- **Positive → Positive**: Repulsion (default)
- **Negative → Negative**: Neutral (default)

### Conservation Laws

The simulator respects physical conservation principles:
1. **Mass Conservation**: Total mass preserved in mergers
2. **Energy Conservation**: Kinetic energy redistributed
3. **Momentum Conservation**: Vector sum maintained
4. **Charge Conservation**: Net charge preserved

### Deformation Mechanics

Bands deform based on field forces:
- Stretching along force directions
- Spring-like restoration (Hooke's law)
- Damped oscillations
- Size limits (25-250% of original)
