2. **Automatically gets metadata** (`metadata.json` file)
3. **Can include documentation** (README.md or other .md files)
4. **Supports any web technologies** (CSS, JavaScript, external libraries)

### Experiment Structure

```
experiments/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-experiment/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML file (required)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metadata.json       # Auto-generated metadata
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Documentation (optional)

        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logo.png
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data.json
```

### Metadata System

The `metadata.json` file contains:

```json
{
  "name": "My Amazing Experiment",
  "description": "A detailed description of what this experiment does",
  "tags": ["javascript", "visualization", "demo"],
  "rating": 4,
  "requiredWorkflows": ["dev-setup", "api-server"],

- **Purpose Tags**: `demo`, `prototype`, `learning`, `experiment`
- **Status Tags**: `working`, `broken`, `in-progress`, `complete`
- **Category Tags**: `visualization`, `game`, `tool`, `api`, `ui-component`

**Search and Filtering**:
- Search by experiment name
- Filter by description content
- Find by any tag
- Combine multiple search terms

## Service Management

### Understanding Services

Services are long-running processes that continue executing until manually stopped. Common examples:

- **Development Servers**: webpack-dev-server, create-react-app, Next.js dev server
- **API Servers**: Express servers, Flask applications, Django development server
- **Databases**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis (if running locally)
- **Build Watchers**: Sass/SCSS watchers, TypeScript compilers in watch mode
- **Testing Tools**: Jest in watch mode, Karma test runners

### Service Configuration

When creating a service, you configure:

**Basic Information**:
- **Service ID**: Unique identifier (use kebab-case: `my-api-server`)
- **Name**: Human-readable name for display
- **Description**: What the service does and why it's needed

**Execution Settings**:
- **Working Directory**: Where to run the service (relative to app root)
- **Command**: The exact command to execute

**Common Service Examples**:

```json
{
  "react-dev-server": {
    "name": "React Development Server",
    "description": "Hot-reloading development server for React application",
    "workingDir": "./frontend",
    "command": "npm start"
  },
  
  "express-api": {
    "name": "Express API Server",
    "description": "Backend API server with live reloading",
    "workingDir": "./backend",
    "command": "npm run dev"
  },
  
  "sass-watcher": {
    "name": "Sass Compiler",
    "description": "Watches and compiles SCSS files to CSS",
    "workingDir": "./styles",
    "command": "sass --watch src:dist"
  }
}
```

### Service Lifecycle Management

**Starting Services**:
1. Click the green "Start" button
2. Service spawns as a background process
3. Console output immediately available
4. Status indicator turns green with "Running" label

**Monitoring Services**:
- **Visual Indicators**: Green dot = running, red dot = stopped
- **Real-time Console**: Click terminal icon to view live output
- **Status Information**: See if service is currently active
- **Running Count**: Navbar shows total number of running services

**Stopping Services**:
1. Click the red "Stop" button
2. Service receives SIGTERM signal for graceful shutdown
3. Status indicator turns red with "Stopped" label
4. Console shows shutdown messages

### Service Dependencies

Link services to experiments so they start automatically:

1. **Edit Experiment Metadata**
2. **Add to Dependencies Array**: Include service IDs
3. **Automatic Discovery**: Services appear in experiment details
4. **One-click Starting**: Start all dependencies from experiment view

### Working Directory Best Practices

- **Use Relative Paths**: `./frontend`, `./api`, `./tools/build`
- **Verify Paths Exist**: Application will error if directory doesn't exist
- **Consider Process Dependencies**: Some tools need to run from specific locations
- **Test Thoroughly**: Always test services after creation

## Command Management

### Understanding Commands

Commands are one-time executable tasks that run to completion. Unlike services, they:

- **Execute once** and then finish
- **Return a result** (success or failure)
- **Show all output** during execution
- **Don't continue running** in the background

### Common Command Types

**Installation Commands**:
```json
{
  "install-frontend": {
    "name": "Install Frontend Dependencies",
    "description": "Install all npm packages for the frontend",
    "workingDir": "./frontend",
    "command": "npm install"
  }
}
```

**Build Commands**:
```json
{
  "build-production": {
    "name": "Production Build",
    "description": "Create optimized production build",
    "workingDir": "./",
    "command": "npm run build"
  }
}
```

**Testing Commands**:
```json
{
  "run-tests": {
    "name": "Run Test Suite",
    "description": "Execute all unit and integration tests",
    "workingDir": "./",
    "command": "npm test"
  }
}
```

**Utility Commands**:
```json
{
  "clean-cache": {
    "name": "Clean Node Cache",
    "description": "Clear npm cache and node_modules",
    "workingDir": "./",
    "command": "rm -rf node_modules && npm cache clean --force"
  }
}
```

### Command Execution Process

1. **Click Execute**: Command starts immediately
2. **Console Opens**: Real-time output window appears
3. **Live Output**: Watch command progress in real-time
4. **Completion Status**: Success (green) or failure (red) indication
5. **Output History**: Console remains available for review

### Command Best Practices

**Naming Conventions**:
- Use descriptive, action-oriented names
- Include context: "Install Frontend Dependencies" not just "Install"
- Be specific: "Run Unit Tests" vs "Run All Tests Including E2E"

**Command Design**:
- **Make them idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times
- **Include error handling**: Commands should fail gracefully
- **Provide clear output**: Include progress indicators when possible
- **Keep them focused**: One command, one clear purpose

**Working Directory Strategy**:
- **Be explicit**: Always specify the correct working directory
- **Test paths**: Verify directories exist before saving commands
- **Use relative paths**: Keep configurations portable across machines

## Workflow Management

### Understanding Workflows

Workflows are automated sequences that combine multiple services and commands to achieve complex goals. They're perfect for:

- **Environment Setup**: Install dependencies, start services, run migrations
- **Deployment Pipelines**: Build, test, and deploy applications
- **Testing Workflows**: Set up test environment, run tests, generate reports
- **Development Onboarding**: Complete setup for new team members

### Workflow Architecture

Each workflow consists of:

**Metadata**:
- **Workflow ID**: Unique identifier
- **Name**: Human-readable name
- **Description**: What the workflow accomplishes
- **Working Directory**: Default directory for all steps

**Steps Array**:
- **Ordered sequence** of actions
- **Each step** can be a service or command
- **Error handling** per step
- **Timing control** with delays

### Step Types

**Existing Service Steps**:
- Start a predefined service
- Perfect for starting development servers, databases
- Service continues running after step completes

**Existing Command Steps**:
- Execute a predefined command
- Command runs to completion before next step
- Perfect for builds, installations, tests

### Advanced Step Configuration

Each step supports:

**Basic Settings**:
- **Name**: Descriptive name for the step
- **Type**: Service or command
- **Target**: Which service/command to execute

**Advanced Settings**:
- **Working Directory**: Override workflow default
- **Delay**: Wait time after step completion (milliseconds)
- **Continue on Error**: Whether to proceed if step fails

### Error Handling Strategies

**Stop on Error (Default)**:
- Workflow stops at first failed step
- Prevents cascading failures
- Good for critical setup workflows

**Continue on Error**:
- Workflow continues even if step fails
- Useful for optional steps
- Good for cleanup or reporting workflows

### Workflow Execution Process

1. **Initialization**: Workflow console opens automatically
2. **Step-by-Step Execution**: Each step runs in sequence
3. **Real-time Progress**: Visual progress indicator updates
4. **Console Aggregation**: All step output appears in workflow console
5. **Completion Status**: Success/failure indication with summary

### Workflow Examples

### Required vs Optional Workflows in Experiments

**Required Workflows**:
- Block experiment loading until completed
- Perfect for essential setup (databases, API servers)
- Shown with warning styling
- "Load Experiment" disabled until completion

**Optional Workflows**:
- Can run before or after experiment loading
- Great for enhancements (monitoring, debugging tools)
- Shown with informational styling
- Don't block experiment loading

## Console System

### Real-time Console Architecture

The console system uses **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for real-time communication:

1. **Browser Connection**: Establishes SSE connection to server
2. **Process Output**: All process stdout/stderr captured
3. **Broadcast System**: Server broadcasts output to all connected clients
4. **Live Updates**: Console windows update immediately

### Console Window Features

**Draggable Windows**:
- Click and drag console windows anywhere on screen
- Automatic collision detection
- Remember position during session

**Window Controls**:
- **Show/Hide**: Minimize without closing
- **Clear**: Remove all output history
- **Close**: Permanently close console

**Output Types**:
- **Standard Output (stdout)**: Regular output in white text
- **Error Output (stderr)**: Error messages in red text
- **Timestamps**: All messages include precise timestamps

### Console Manager Interface

**Centralized Overview**:
- See all active consoles in one place
- Process type identification (service, command, workflow)
- Status indicators (visible, hidden, running, stopped)
- Quick access controls

**Management Actions**:
- **Toggle Visibility**: Show/hide individual consoles
- **Close All**: Shut down all console windows
- **Filter by Type**: Show only services, commands, or workflows

### Console Output Persistence

**Session Persistence**:
- Console output persists during browser session
- Refresh page without losing history
- Reconnect automatically after brief disconnections

**Output Limits**:
- Automatic cleanup of very old output
- Configurable retention policies
- Memory management for long-running processes

### Console Best Practices

**For Development**:
- Keep relevant consoles open during active development
- Use console manager to organize multiple outputs
- Clear consoles periodically to reduce clutter

**For Debugging**:
- Check both stdout and stderr for complete picture
- Look for timestamp patterns to identify issues
- Save important output before clearing consoles

## Configuration Guide

```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version

# Should be 14.0.0 or higher
# If not, update Node.js from nodejs.org
```

**Port Already in Use**:
```bash
# Error: EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::7890
# Solution 1: Kill process using port
lsof -i :7890
kill -9 <PID>

# Solution 2: Use different port
PORT=8080 npm start
```

**Permission Errors**:
```bash
# If you get permission errors
sudo chown -R $USER ~/.npm
npm cache clean --force
```

### Service Management Issues

**Services Won't Start**:
1. **Check Working Directory**: Ensure path exists and is correct
2. **Verify Command**: Test command manually in terminal
3. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure all required tools are installed
4. **Review Console Output**: Look for specific error messages

**Services Start But Don't Work**:
1. **Check Port Conflicts**: Services might be fighting for same port
2. **Verify Configuration**: Check service-specific config files
3. **Review Environment Variables**: Ensure all required env vars are set
4. **Check File Permissions**: Ensure service has access to required files

**Console Output Not Showing**:
1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for JavaScript errors
2. **Verify SSE Connection**: Check Network tab for `/api/console/stream`
3. **Check Firewall**: Ensure no blocking of local connections
4. **Try Browser Refresh**: Sometimes SSE connections need reset

### Experiment Loading Issues

**Experiments Don't Appear**:
1. **Check HTML Files**: Ensure at least one `.html` file exists
2. **Verify Directory Structure**: Experiments must be in `experiments/` directory
3. **Check File Permissions**: Ensure application can read files
4. **Review Console Errors**: Check browser console for errors

**Required Workflows Block Loading**:
1. **Check Workflow Status**: Ensure all required workflows completed successfully
2. **Verify Services Still Running**: Some workflows start services that might have stopped
3. **Review Workflow Logs**: Check console output for workflow execution errors
4. **Clear Workflow State**: Sometimes requires re-running workflows

**Fullscreen Mode Issues**:
1. **Browser Compatibility**: Some browsers handle fullscreen differently
2. **Popup Blockers**: Ensure popup blockers aren't interfering
3. **Security Restrictions**: Some browsers block fullscreen from iframes

### Performance Issues

**Slow Console Updates**:
1. **Check SSE Connection**: Verify stable connection to server
2. **Limit Console History**: Clear old console data regularly
3. **Check Network**: Ensure stable local network connection
4. **Browser Resources**: Check if browser is running low on memory

**High Memory Usage**:
1. **Console Data Accumulation**: Clear console outputs periodically
2. **Too Many Running Services**: Stop unnecessary services
3. **Browser Memory**: Check browser task manager for memory usage
4. **Process Cleanup**: Restart application if memory usage grows too high

### Configuration Issues

**services.json Corruption**:
```bash
# Backup current file
cp services.json services.json.broken

# Restore from backup
cp services.json.backup services.json

# Or reset to defaults
rm services.json
# Restart application to regenerate
```

**Invalid JSON Format**:
1. **Use JSON Validator**: Paste configuration into online JSON validator
2. **Check Common Errors**: Missing commas, unmatched brackets, unescaped quotes
3. **Use Text Editor**: Use editor with JSON syntax highlighting
4. **Validate Before Saving**: Always validate JSON before saving changes

### Network and Connectivity Issues

**SSE Connection Failures**:
1. **Check Browser Support**: Ensure browser supports EventSource
2. **Verify Server Running**: Confirm server is accessible at correct port
3. **Check Proxy Settings**: Corporate proxies might block SSE
4. **Try Different Browser**: Test with different browser to isolate issue

**API Request Failures**:
1. **Check Network Tab**: Review failed requests in browser dev tools
2. **Verify Server Status**: Ensure server is running and responding
3. **Check Request Format**: Verify API requests have correct format
4. **Review CORS Settings**: Ensure CORS is properly configured

## Best Practices

### Experiment Organization

**Naming Conventions**:
- Use descriptive, kebab-case folder names: `react-todo-app`, `data-visualization-d3`
- Include technology in name when relevant: `vue-component-library`, `node-api-template`
- Use versioning for iterations: `login-form-v1`, `login-form-v2`

**Metadata Management**:
- **Always fill out descriptions**: Future you will thank you
- **Use consistent tagging**: Establish tag conventions and stick to them
- **Rate your experiments**: Helps prioritize which ones to maintain
- **Link related experiments**: Build a knowledge graph of your work

**Documentation Standards**:
- **Include README.md**: Explain what the experiment does and how to use it
- **Document dependencies**: List any required services or setup
- **Add screenshots**: Visual documentation is incredibly helpful
- **Include lessons learned**: Note what worked and what didn't

### Service and Command Design

**Service Best Practices**:
- **Make services stateless**: Services should be able to restart cleanly
- **Use health checks**: Commands that verify service is ready
- **Handle graceful shutdown**: Services should respond properly to SIGTERM
- **Log meaningful information**: Include startup messages and error details

**Command Best Practices**:
- **Make commands idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times
- **Include progress indicators**: Show what's happening during execution
- **Handle errors gracefully**: Provide clear error messages
- **Clean up after yourself**: Remove temporary files and processes

**Configuration Management**:
- **Use relative paths**: Keep configurations portable
- **Document environment requirements**: Note any special setup needed
- **Version your configurations**: Commit services.json to version control
- **Test on fresh environments**: Verify setup works on clean machines

### Workflow Design Principles

**Workflow Structure**:
- **Keep workflows focused**: One clear purpose per workflow
- **Use descriptive step names**: Make it clear what each step does
- **Handle failures gracefully**: Use `continueOnError` appropriately
- **Add appropriate delays**: Give services time to start up properly

**Dependency Management**:
- **Order steps carefully**: Ensure dependencies start before dependents
- **Group related operations**: Keep similar steps together
- **Use conditional logic**: Skip steps that aren't needed
- **Test workflow isolation**: Ensure workflows can run independently

**Error Recovery**:
- **Plan for failures**: What happens when steps fail?
- **Provide rollback options**: Commands to undo changes if needed
- **Log comprehensive information**: Make debugging easier
- **Test failure scenarios**: Deliberately break things to test recovery

### Team Collaboration

**Shared Configuration**:
- **Commit services.json**: Include in version control
- **Document team standards**: Establish naming and organization conventions
- **Use consistent environments**: Ensure everyone has similar setups
- **Share workflow patterns**: Establish common workflow templates

A: The Experiment Browser focuses specifically on organizing and running experimental projects with their dependencies. Unlike IDEs or build tools, it's designed for managing multiple projects and their associated services in one interface.

**Q: Can I use this for production deployments?**
A: No, this is designed as a development tool. It lacks production features like authentication, SSL, load balancing, and security hardening.

**Q: Does it work on Windows/Mac/Linux?**
A: Yes, it's built on Node.js and works on all platforms. Commands and services may need platform-specific adjustments.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How do I change the default port?**
A: Set the PORT environment variable: `PORT=8080 npm start`

**Q: Can I run this on a remote server?**
A: It's designed for local development, but you can bind to other interfaces by modifying the server configuration. Add proper security measures if exposing to network.

**Q: How do I add custom CSS themes?**
A: Create custom CSS files and modify the HTML to include them. The application uses Bulma CSS framework which supports easy customization.

**Q: Can I integrate with Docker?**
A: Yes! Create services that run Docker commands, or commands that build and run Docker containers. Example:
```json
{
  "docker-api": {
    "name": "Docker API Server",
    "description": "API server running in Docker container",
    "command": "docker run -p 3000:3000 my-api-image"
  }
}
```

### Workflow Questions

**Q: What happens if a workflow step fails?**
A: By default, the workflow stops. You can set `continueOnError: true` on individual steps to continue despite failures.

**Q: Can workflows call other workflows?**
A: Currently, workflows can only contain services and commands. Nested workflow calls aren't supported but could be added as a future feature.

**Q: How do I make workflows run faster?**
A: Reduce delays between steps, run independent steps in parallel (manually), and optimize individual commands and services.

### Troubleshooting Questions

**Q: Console output isn't showing up, what's wrong?**
A: Check the browser console for errors, verify the SSE connection in the Network tab, and ensure no firewall or proxy is blocking the connection.

**Q: Services start but experiments can't connect to them, why?**
A: Check that services are binding to the correct host/port, verify firewall settings, and ensure experiments are using the correct URLs.

**Q: The application is using too much memory, how do I fix it?**
A: Clear console outputs regularly, stop unnecessary services, and restart the application periodically to clear accumulated memory.

**Q: Can I recover deleted services/commands/workflows?**
A: If you have `services.json` in version control, you can restore from there. Otherwise, you'll need to recreate them manually.

### Advanced Questions

**Q: Can I extend the application with plugins?**
A: The application doesn't have a formal plugin system, but you can modify the source code to add new features. Consider contributing improvements back to the project.

**Q: How do I monitor resource usage of running services?**
A: You can create commands that run system monitoring tools (like `ps`, `top`, `htop`) or integrate with system monitoring tools.

**Q: Can I run this in a team environment?**
A: Yes, but each developer needs their own instance. You can share configuration files through version control for consistent setups.

**Q: How do I backup my entire setup?**
A: Backup the `services.json` file and the entire `experiments/` directory. If using version control, commit these files to preserve your work.
